## About

Back when I was in the Philippines, I was trying to rennovate our house. 

Then I have encountered a huge problem, I do not know any carpenter at all. 

My first instinct was to look over the internet, I searched on Google and looked into Yelp, but I could not find anything. Then one of my friend told me, try facebook, and indeed, I was able to find some on facebook but the challenging part is you have to scroll all the way down to even look for one. A post form someone can easily be drowned by the newest postings, it was a complete waste of time. Then they do not have any ratings or comments, there is no way I can confirm if they are good or not. So I went on and asking my neighbor's if they know any carpenter, and someone pointed me to someone who knows someone that is a carpenter. 

To make the story short, it took me over a week to be able to find a carpenter near me and I do not have any idea if he is actually good or not.

Ever since that day, if there is a website like airbnb that creates an ecosystem for units for rent, then there is no reason why I cannot create an ecosystem for bluecollar workers.

This project intends to solve the problem that I encountered and create an environment where bluecollar workers and potential clients meet together in one platform. That a good job is actually rated good, so as the bad ones. That it helps bluecollar workers create a free marketing for their skills set and provide a venue for them to guage their performance. That potential clients can easily find bluecollar workers near their area and can see if their portfolio.
